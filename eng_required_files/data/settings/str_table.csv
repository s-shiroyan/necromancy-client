#Dungeon selection description (provisional)
11,99,0,"A sewer derived from the Aria River runs alongside Itox, the capital of Dimento.\n\nThrough years of development its paths have become labyrinthine, and some routes are now completely unused.\n\nTo supply hard to find water to the recent influx of adventurers, the city planners have decided to immediately restore the closed sewer paths, however those that came to work on the sewers discovered unknown paths and strange beasts beneath the water."
11,99,1,"A rash of sudden disappearances have been occurring near the Kingdom of Dimento.\n\nSome say they are heavenly abductions . . .\n\nOthers have seen people that seem to have been possessed by the Dragoon ruins to the northwest of Itox, causing them to walk off into oblivion.\n\nA cult in yellow robes has been seen nearby, contributing further to the rumors."
11,99,2,"A labyrinth built by a designer named Azarm to train beginning adventurers.\n\nHowever, Azarm disappeared before completion of the structure, and some claim that Azarm's real goal was to hide in the labyrinth all along.  \n\nFrom the depths of the labyrinth, one can faintly hear what sounds like the cries of a man.\n"
